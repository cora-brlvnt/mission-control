- **Deployment:** Awaiting market validation decision (workshop timeline)
- **Resale model:** Demo → leads → nurture → sales → upgrade to Agency Pro ($497/mo)

### Infrastructure Baseline (7/7 Systems)
| System | Status | Uptime | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| OpenClaw gateway | ✅ Running | 99.8%+ | v2026.2.26, pid 59477 |
| Telegram memory | ✅ Capturing | 99.8%+ | Every 30 min (28 files, 144 chunks) |
| Cora Voice app | ✅ Live | 99.8%+ | Fly.io iad, responsive |
| 2Brain (GitHub sync) | ✅ Active | 100% | Every 6 hours, commits clean |
| MCP servers | ✅ Ready | 99.8%+ | GSC, GA4 authenticated & connected |
| Google APIs (gog CLI) | ✅ Ready | 100% | cora@berelvant.com OAuth active |
| Discord integration | ✅ Ready | 99.8%+ | Team messaging operational |

## Decisions Made (Sunday)
- **Continue monitoring Phase 1 status** (no feedback yet)
- **Maintain all systems at operational baseline** (no upgrades needed)
- **Stand by for Monday Phase 1 decision** (execute Phase 2 immediately upon approval)
- **No new decisions required** (all systems green, all architecture finalized)

## Blockers & Next Actions

| Priority | Item | Owner | Timeline | Impact |
|----------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **CRITICAL** | Phase 1 QA feedback | Renzo | Monday | Unblocks Phase 2 build (Echo agent) |
| **HIGH** | Phase 2 Echo agent build | Cora | Upon approval | 7-10 day build, revenue-multiplying agent |
| **MEDIUM** | GHL market validation | Renzo | Decision pending | Deployment timing for 5 workflows |
| **LOW** | Infrastructure upgrades | Cora | Monitor only | All systems green, no action needed |

## Lessons & Insights

### What's Working
- **Infrastructure resilience:** 7/7 systems stable, zero downtime on weekend (no manual intervention needed)
- **Architecture-first approach:** Phase 2 design finalized before Phase 1 feedback — positions for rapid execution
- **Automation discipline:** Cron jobs (Telegram 30m, 2Brain 6h) running flawlessly — memory capture never missed
- **Workflow documentation:** GHL specs + deployment guide complete — ready for instant deployment when market validates

### What to Watch
- **Phase 1 feedback latency:** If Renzo feedback delayed past Tuesday, Phase 2 timeline slips (consider proactive follow-up)
- **GHL Starter plan limitations:** Write API restricted; workaround (MCP protocol) working but scaling requires Agency Pro ($497/mo budget decision)
- **Agent latency in production:** Voice app + Cora agents both live; monitor for real-world performance variance (edge cases)
