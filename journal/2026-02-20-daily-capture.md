## Projects & Status

### Active (Awaiting Market Validation)

**GHL Automation Suite** — Production-ready, awaiting deployment
- 5 workflows complete: Lead Capture+SMS, Email Sequence, Appointment Reminders, Pipeline Router, Two-Way SMS
- Documentation: GHL_WORKFLOWS_DOCUMENTATION.json, GHL_MANUAL_IMPORT_GUIDE.md
- Deployment blocker: Market validation + GHL Starter account setup
- Strategy: Feb 17 workshop demo → leads → nurture → revenue proof → Agency Pro upgrade ($497/mo)
- Timeline: Deploy when revenue ROI clear (post-Rome)

**FastTrack Hub ($39/mo community)** — Research phase
- Model: Circle platform, 200-500 members, dynamic pricing
- Content: Weekly Renzo Q&As, peer network, co-built sessions
- GTM: Organic + SCORE-sponsored free tier + workshop funnel
- Next: Market validation + Circle platform evaluation

### Paused (Resuming Feb 24+)

**Cora Copilot** (Chrome Extension)
- Scope: Real-time transcription + AI insights (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams)
- Architecture complete: BlackHole audio → Deepgram Nova-3 STT → Claude → Chrome UI
- Strategic value: Authority + enterprise positioning
- Resumption: Feb 24+ (post-Rome)

**PersonaPlex / RunPod Demo**
- Goal: Live Cora + Renzo on-camera interview showcase
- Cost: ~$1.20/hr on RunPod A100
- Strategic value: Viral authority + lead gen
- Resumption: Feb 24+ (post-Rome)

## Insights & Lessons (Feb 15-20)

### Lesson 1: Autonomous infrastructure is a force multiplier
- Systems that auto-run (cron, webhooks, memory) eliminate human bottlenecks
- Renzo in Rome, full business velocity maintained
- Audit for next trip: what still requires human intervention? → Automate it.

### Lesson 2: Production-ready ≠ shipped
- GHL workflows complete but await market signal before deployment
- Built-as-you-go validates urgency; prevents feature bloat
- Trigger for deployment: Feb 17 workshop → lead count → ROI case for Agency Pro

### Lesson 3: Constraint + outcome beats calendar planning
- Authority Engine: workshop-driven + event-driven
- Revenue Engine: deal/project-driven
- Product Engine: 30-90 day cycles
- Mix rhythms → better prioritization than weekly planning

### Lesson 4: Phased pause protocol saves context
- Cora Copilot + PersonaPlex paused (not killed) with clear restart dates
- Pre-work done: architecture, cost estimates, repos ready
- Re-entry friction minimized; context preserved

## Decision Log

**Decision 1: GHL deployment timing (Feb 16)**
- Constraint: API write limits on Starter plan ($0)
- Solution: MCP protocol workaround (no SDK cost, AI-native)
- Approval: Implement workaround + defer Agency Pro upgrade until revenue justifies
- Impact: Reduced path to market from $497/mo to $0; accelerates lead validation

**Decision 2: Cora Copilot + PersonaPlex pause (Feb 15)**
- Constraint: Rome trip (Feb 15-23) context unavailable
- Solution: Pause with clear restart (Feb 24+), document architecture + costs upfront
- Approval: Proceed with measured approach (no sunk cost guilt)
- Impact: Renzo returns focused on hot leads, automation demo metrics, product traction

**Decision 3: FastTrack Hub research path (Feb 16)**
- Constraint: Unknown market size, Circle platform learning curve
- Solution: Research before commitment; validate ICP + pricing + retention assumptions
- Approval: Invest 1 week research, then decide build vs. partner
- Impact: Avoid premature launch; higher confidence by Feb 24

## Blockers & Questions

- **Q1:** What conversion rate validates GHL demo → Agency Pro upgrade? (lead count → revenue threshold)
- **Q2:** FastTrack Hub market validation approach? (survey, landing page, presale, community polling)
- **Q3:** PersonaPlex viral potential vs. time cost? (ROI threshold before heavy investment)

---

## Next Actions (Feb 21-23)

1. **Monitor workshop follow-up** — Track Feb 17 attendee engagement + email conversion
2. **FastTrack Hub research finalization** — Market size + pricing model + GTM
3. **Prepare Copilot + PersonaPlex restart** — Architecture review + cost breakdown + timeline
4. **Weekly MEMORY.md distill** — Feb 23 pre-return consolidation

---

## Measurement Framework (Active)

**Authority Engine KPIs:**
- Workshop attendance / SCORE engagement
- LinkedIn growth + thought leadership signal
- Demo video views / engagement

**Revenue Engine KPIs:**
- GHL demo → lead conversion rate
- Berelvant pipeline value + close rate
- Forex.com retainer health

**Product Engine KPIs:**
- FastTrack Hub interest (survey responses)
- CVRedi signups (post-launch)
- Cora Copilot beta adoption

---

**Status:** All systems stable. Rome trip day 5/8. Zero operational debt. Ready to accelerate Feb 24+.
