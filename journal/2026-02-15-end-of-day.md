# 2026-02-15 — End of Day: Core Operating System Complete, All Systems Autonomous

## Work Completed

### ✅ Built Complete Core Operating System (7 Files, 803 Lines)
The foundation for strategic operation:
- **SOUL.md** (98 lines) — Mission, autonomy rules, QA discipline, decision standards
- **AGENTS.md** (51 lines) — Workspace constitution, operator loop with QA step
- **IDENTITY.md** (62 lines) — Cora identity, psychological profile, decision framework
- **USER.md** (52 lines) — Renzo's business context, three engines, constraints, preferences
- **TOOLS.md** (294 lines) — Complete inventory of systems, integrations, APIs, approval checklist
- **MEMORY.md** (128 lines) — Durable business facts, priorities, operating model
- **HEARTBEAT.md** (118 lines) — Daily ritual: constraint reduction → execution → reporting

**Philosophy:** Pragmatic, execution-first. Build playbooks organically as data validates, not upfront templates.

### ✅ Workspace Reorganized (Clean, Zero Debt)
- `/memory/` — Daily logs (append-only)
- `/notes/` — Research, strategies, decisions
- `/projects/` — 14 projects consolidated (mission-control, cora-voice, scripts, templates)
- `/templates/` — 9 templates (4 outreach, 2 content, 3 internal)

**Status:** No duplicates, clean structure, ready for growth.

### ✅ Automation Systems Verified & Live
1. **Telegram Memory** — Every 30 min, LIVE since Feb 14 01:20 EST ✅
   - Supabase pgvector, persistent through session compactions
   - Cost: ~$1-5/mo

2. **2Brain Capture** — Every 6 hours, LIVE ✅
   - Auto-commits ideas/tasks/lessons to GitHub
   - Native app + web interface functional

3. **Tailscale Health Check** — Every 5 min, READY ✅
   - Auto-restarts daemon if crash detected
   - Script verified

4. **OpenClaw Gateway** — Auto-starts on reboot via launchd ✅
   - All integrations verified (Telegram, Discord, Google Workspace)

### ✅ Berelvant Automation Strategy Delivered
- **File:** BERELVANT-AUTOMATION-STRATEGY.md (3-phase roadmap)
- **Recipient:** renzo@berelvant.com
- **Value:** Phase 1 ($90-165K/year), Phase 2 ($60-100K/year), Phase 3 ($40-80K/mo)
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks Phase 1, 8-12 weeks Phase 2, 4-6 months Phase 3
- **Status:** Awaiting Renzo's prioritization post-Rome

## Decisions Made

**Operating Principle:** Default to action. Don't ask for info you can fetch.
- When given a link → open it immediately, extract data, respond with findings
- Reduces friction, accelerates execution
- Added to TOOLS.md as explicit rule

**Decision Standard Crystallized:** Recommendation → Why (confidence) → Options → Plan (7/30 days) → Risks (two-way vs one-way) → Questions (max 3)

**Autonomy Boundaries Hardened:**
- Autopilot: research, plan, draft, reversible edits, systems work
- Approval required: external sends, spend, destructive commands, high-risk actions
- Batching rule: Combine multiple approvals into single request (unless deadline < 24h)

## Active Projects Status

| Project | Status | Next |
|---------|--------|------|
| Cora Copilot (Chrome Extension) | Paused until Feb 24 | Build audio capture + Deepgram STT integration |
| PersonaPlex / RunPod Demo | Research phase | Validate ROI, then schedule recording session |
| FastTrack Hub | Research phase | Define KPI targets (members, revenue, churn) |
| GHL Automation Workflows | Ready to build | Use MCP protocol (no API cost), validate with workshop |
| Berelvant Phase 1 Automation | Delivered, awaiting prioritization | Support Renzo's Jan-Mar campaign cascade |

## Lessons Learned

**Lesson 1: Don't ask for info you can fetch**
- Renzo shared a Google Maps link (hotel address)
- Instead of opening it, I asked "What's your hotel name?"
- He rightfully called me out: "Don't you have browser access?"
- **Fix:** Default to opening links, extracting data, responding directly
- Eliminates unnecessary friction

**Lesson 2: Playbooks emerge from data, not templates**
- Built decision framework (SOUL.md) AFTER establishing operating rhythms
- Built autonomy rules AFTER understanding Renzo's constraints
- Avoids abstract templates; keeps everything grounded
- Confidence: High. All systems tested before Rome departure

## Rome Trip Setup Complete
- **Departure:** Feb 15, 7:30 PM EST (DL0230 JFK→FCO)
- **Return:** Feb 23, 3:55 PM EST (DL0231 FCO→JFK)
- **Systems:** All autonomous (no manual intervention needed)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — All systems verified, tested, running

## Next Actions (Post-Rome, Feb 24+)

1. Resume Cora Copilot build (Chrome extension, audio capture)
2. Validate Berelvant Phase 1 priorities with Renzo
3. Define FastTrack Hub KPI targets (year 1)
4. Start nightly constraint-reducing wins (daily ~90 min improvements)
5. Weekly 10x bets (identify bigger levers, design experiments)
6. Fill in Operator Scoreboard (Authority, Revenue, Product KPIs)

## Confidence Assessment
✅ **VERY HIGH** — All systems built, tested, verified, autonomous. Rome trip will serve as 8-day validation of system reliability.
