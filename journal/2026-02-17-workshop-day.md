# 2026-02-17 — Workshop Day: Authority Launch & Lead Capture Live

## Status Summary
**Renzo:** In Rome (citizenship processing), SCORE workshop happening today (afternoon Rome time)  
**Mission:** Live demo + lead capture for FastTrack Hub funnel + GHL market validation  
**All systems:** Autonomous, zero manual intervention required during workshop

## Today's Focus: Authority Engine Activation

### 📊 Workshop Execution (Feb 17, Afternoon Rome Time)

**What's happening:**
- Live Renzo + Cora Copilot demo (real-time voice → transcript → automation)
- SCORE attendees (~25 target) experiencing Claude for first time
- Immediate email capture for FastTrack Hub funnel
- GHL workflow validation (collect 20+ leads)

**Materials deployed:**
- ✅ CLAUDE_COWORK_BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.md (attendee guide)
- ✅ CLAUDE_COWORK_WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md (Renzo delivery playbook)
- ✅ GHL workflow documentation (5 workflows, manual import guide)
- ✅ Email sequences pre-built (Day 1, 3, 6 nurture)
- ✅ Lead capture form ready

**Success metrics (baseline):**
- Attendance: 25+ (target)
- Email capture: 20+ qualified leads
- Demo completion: Real-time voice→transcript→ideas (flawless execution)
- Feedback sentiment: "Claude is practical" (target) vs "too technical"

### 🎯 What We're Validating Today

**Hypothesis 1: Live Claude demo converts workshop attendees to FastTrack Hub**
- If attendees see real-time Cora Copilot in action → they perceive Claude as accessible + practical → convert at 40%+ to community
- Test: Measure email captures + workshop survey feedback
- Kill criteria: <10% conversion or "too technical" feedback (indicates messaging misalignment)

**Hypothesis 2: GHL workflows resonate as automation proof-of-concept**
- If Renzo demonstrates 2-3 GHL workflows → attendees believe "we can automate our business" → 30%+ express interest in Berelvant retainer
- Test: Follow-up "interested in automation?" in email sequence
- Kill criteria: <5% engagement on automation asks (indicates problem fit issue)

**Hypothesis 3: SCORE workshop attendance validates demand for authority positioning**
- If we fill a 25-person workshop with decision-makers → Renzo's "AI Growth Architect" positioning resonates → validate FastTrack Hub market
- Test: Measure email list quality (company size, titles, ICP match)
- Kill criteria: <50% ICP match or >50% cold/irrelevant emails (indicates wrong audience)

### 🔄 Post-Workshop Workflow (Feb 17-23, Automated)

**Cron jobs running during Rome trip:**
- **Telegram memory capture** (every 30 min) — Any workshop mentions, feedback, follow-ups
- **2Brain idea capture** (every 6 hours) — Lessons learned, adjustments
- **GHL lead nurture** (immediate) — Day 1 email for all new captures
- **N8N video analysis** (on-demand) — If workshop recorded, extract engagement metrics

**No manual intervention required.** All systems will:
1. Capture attendee emails via form
2. Trigger Day 1 email (GHL automation)
3. Log feedback mentions in Telegram memory
4. Auto-update lead pipeline

### 📈 Lead Pipeline (Real-Time View)

| Stage | Count | Status | Next Action |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Workshop attendees | ~25 | LIVE TODAY | Capture emails |
| Email-captured leads | 20+ target | Post-workshop | Enter GHL pipeline |
| Day 1 email sent | TBD | 24h post-workshop | Measure open rate |
| Interested in FastTrack | Target 8+ | Day 3 | Email with pricing + access |
| Interested in automation | Target 6+ | Day 6 | Sales qualify → Berelvant retainer |
| Converted (either funnel) | Target 3+ | Mar 15 | Close or nurture ongoing |

## Lessons from Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Lesson 1: Practical Materials Win Over Polish
- 14.5 KB tutorial guide (copy-paste ready) > fancy UI
- Reason: Attendees want immediate usability, not aesthetics
- Application: For FastTrack Hub, prioritize "what can I do right now" over "beautiful dashboard"

### Lesson 2: Demonstrate, Don't Explain
- "Show 2 workflows live" > "explain 5 workflows in slides"
- Reason: Humans trust what they see; theory is forgettable
- Application: Every follow-up should include a small, real action (code snippet, workflow template, prompt)

### Lesson 3: Validate Before Spending
- Run GHL on $0 Starter plan first > upgrade to $497/mo Agency Pro immediately
- Reason: Market validation proves ROI before commitment
- Application: All major tools/spends: demand customer proof before spending (workshops generate leads that justify tech spend)

### Lesson 4: Let Systems Do the Work
- Automated cron jobs run during travel > manual updates after return
- Reason: Reduces decision fatigue; keeps momentum alive
- Application: Every successful cron job = one less bottleneck when Renzo returns

## Decision: Authority Engine Now Activates

**Decision made:** Treat workshop as Phase 1 of Authority Engine (not a one-off event).

**Why:**
- FastTrack Hub depends on attendee trust (authority)
- Berelvant sales depend on "proven track record" (case studies from happy workshop attendees)
- Personal brand depends on consistency (one workshop = foundation for more)

**Action:** 
- Measure every attendee's journey (email → engagement → conversion)
- Build case studies from each who moves through any funnel
- Use social proof in future marketing (testimonials, success stories)

## What's Next (Prioritized)

**During workshop (Feb 17, afternoon Rome time):**
1. Live demo execution (Renzo + Cora Copilot)
2. Attendee email capture
3. Real-time Telegram memory capture (Renzo may mention feedback)

**Post-workshop (Feb 18-23):**
1. Review email capture list (quality, ICP match, engagement)
2. Analyze Day 1 email open rates (24h check)
3. Identify top 3-5 hottest leads for manual follow-up (Renzo can do async)
4. Capture lessons in journal (what worked, what to adjust)

**Return from Rome (Feb 23, 3:55 PM EST):**
1. Full analysis of workshop ROI (attendance, email list quality, conversion predictions)
2. Decide: Repeat workshop monthly? Modify positioning? Double down?
3. Launch FastTrack Hub access for qualified attendees
4. Begin Berelvant sales outreach for automation-interested leads

**March 1 onward:**
1. FastTrack Hub with live content from attendees
2. Berelvant Phase 1 demos for qualified leads
3. Cora Copilot beta launch
4. Scale authority engine (more workshops, LinkedIn visibility)

## Success Definition (Workshop)

✅ **Done well if:**
- 20+ emails captured (ICP-qualified)
- "Practical," "accessible," or "ready to use" mentioned in feedback
- 0 "too technical" or "confusing" feedback
- 3+ attendees express automation interest
- Renzo feels energized (not drained) by delivery

❌ **Red flags (pivot if seen):**
- <10 emails captured (messaging misalignment)
- Majority feedback: "too technical" (positioning problem)
- 0 automation interest expressed (problem fit issue)
- Renzo reports "audience didn't engage" (delivery or audience selection issue)

**Next cron capture:** 6:00 AM, Feb 18 (morning EST, post-workshop review ready)

**Tracking:** This entry + workshop results → update MEMORY.md with Authority Engine launch baseline → plan next repeats or pivots
