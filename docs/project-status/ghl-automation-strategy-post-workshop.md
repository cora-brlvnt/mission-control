# GHL Automation Strategy — Post-Workshop Status

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Market Validation (Post-Rome, Feb 24+)
**Timeline:** After workshop data analyzed + Renzo validates lead quality

**Approach:**
- Manual import of 5 workflows (documented step-by-step guide exists)
- Starter plan ($0) — full read capability via MCP protocol
- No paid tier required to validate market

**Workflows Ready:**
1. Lead Capture + SMS (form → CRM + notification)
2. Email Nurture Sequence (Days 1, 3, 6, 9)
3. Appointment Reminders (SMS + email)
4. Pipeline Router (deal stage → routing + alerts)
5. Two-Way SMS (parse inbound → respond → log)

### Phase 2: Market Adoption (Contingent on Phase 1 success)
**Trigger:** 10+ leads from workshop conversion OR Renzo identifies revenue opportunity

**Action:** Upgrade GHL to Agency Pro ($497/mo)
- Unlocks write API
- Auto-import capability (no manual setup)
- Workflow templates for scale
- Multi-user team collaboration

### Phase 3: Resale Playbook (Timeline: Q2 2026)
**Model:**
- Demo workflows in workshops → collect leads
- Nurture leads via email sequences → demonstrate ROI
- Pitch GHL Agency Pro as "automation capability"
- Upsell to Berelvant retainer deal ($90-165K Phase 1)
- Workflow package = entry point to larger engagement

## Strategic Value

**Authority:** Demonstrates AI automation sophistication
**Revenue:** Generates qualified leads from workshop attendees
**Product:** Creates teachable demo for FastTrack Hub community

## Cost-Risk Analysis

| Phase | Cost | Risk | Upside |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 (Market validation) | $0 | Low (proves concept) | Validates 5-workflow model |
| Phase 2 (Agency Pro) | $497/mo | Medium (spend without revenue) | Enables auto-import + scale |
| Phase 3 (Resale) | Incl. Phase 2 | Medium (customer acquisition) | $90-165K Berelvant deal |

## Approval Gate
**Waiting on:** Renzo's post-Rome analysis (Feb 24+)
- How many workshop leads?
- Lead quality (email valid, engagement signals)?
- How many converted to FastTrack Hub?
- Does ROI justify Agency Pro upgrade?

**Default:** If ≥5 leads with clear engagement → proceed to Phase 2

## Documentation Status
- ✅ GHL_WORKFLOWS_DOCUMENTATION.json (full specs)
- ✅ GHL_MANUAL_IMPORT_GUIDE.md (UI step-by-step)
- ✅ All 5 workflows production-ready
- ✅ MCP protocol tested (no API cost)

## Next Actions
1. (Feb 24+) Analyze workshop lead data
2. Make Phase 2 decision (market-dependent)
3. If approved: Begin Phase 2 import preparation
4. If deferred: Iterate on Phase 1 (next workshop)
