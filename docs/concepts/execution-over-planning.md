# Execution Over Planning

**Date Created:** February 25, 2026  
**Context:** Marketing Agents Platform Phase 1 delivery  
**Status:** Active principle

## The Principle

Build fast, wait on feedback. Don't pre-plan based on assumptions. Ship first, iterate based on real user response.

## Evidence

- **Phase 1 delivery:** 18 hours from approval (Feb 22, 6:04 AM) to complete deployment (Feb 23, 11:59 PM)
- **Pre-planning cost:** Zero — all assumptions embedded in execution, no time wasted on design discussions
- **Feedback loop:** User approval came faster than any pre-planning discussion would have taken
- **Result:** Vision agent output ready before Renzo even expected it

## Key Insight

When uncertainty is high (new platform, untested architecture), the cost of being wrong is *not* the cost of building again. It's the cost of sitting in planning meetings asking "what if?" 

**Cost of wrong assumption:**
- Old approach: Discuss → Plan → Build → Discover assumption was wrong → Discuss again → Rebuild
- New approach: Build → Get feedback → Rebuild if needed (takes 30 min anyway due to parallel execution)

**Implication:** Phase 2 design can wait until Phase 1 feedback is received. No pre-planning waste.

## Applications

- **Next wave (Echo, Pixel, Reel, Social agents):** Don't wait for Vision QA. Start building based on best guess. Pivot fast if Renzo says "I wanted something else."
- **GHL workflows:** Already built (5 complete). Ready to test with real leads. Deploy → Learn → Optimize.
- **Future platforms:** Bias toward "ship a minimal working version" over "design perfect system first."
