# 2026-02-16 — Noon Checkpoint: Systems Autonomous, SCORE Workshop Materials Ready

## Status Summary
**Renzo:** In Rome (Feb 15-23, returning Feb 23 3:55 PM EST)  
**All systems:** Autonomous and running without intervention  
**Monday workshop:** Materials ready, live demo scheduled (Feb 17, morning Rome time)

## Completed This Morning (6 AM-12 PM)

### 🎯 SCORE Workshop Materials Finalized
- **CLAUDE_COWORK_BEGINNERS_TUTORIAL.md** (14.5 KB) — Step-by-step intro for workshop attendees with no Claude experience
  - Getting started with Claude
  - 3 real-world use cases (lead generation, email automation, code)
  - Copy-paste prompts for immediate use
  - Q&A troubleshooting guide

- **CLAUDE_COWORK_WORKSHOP_GUIDE.md** — Comprehensive framework for Renzo's delivery
  - Opening narrative (why Claude is different)
  - Live demo script (voice recording → transcript → automation ideas)
  - 5 AI use cases for Berelvant clients
  - Q&A handling (common misconceptions + answers)
  - Closing call-to-action (FastTrack Hub, Berelvant retainer offer)

**Why it matters:** Workshop attendees will have a complete, copy-paste-ready guide to explore AI without coaching. Reduces friction between "interesting demo" → "immediate action."

### 📋 GHL Deployment Strategy Documented
**New concept:** `ghl-deployment-strategy.md` (complete playbook)

**Three phases:**
1. **Validation** (Feb 16-17) — Collect 20+ leads from workshop, test 2-3 workflows ($0)
2. **Demonstration** (Feb 24-Mar 15) — Run nurture, measure ROI, build case studies ($0)
3. **Agency Pro Upgrade** (Mar 15+) — Monetize via retainer ($497/mo, 3 clients = $9K/mo revenue)

**Key insight:** Don't buy Agency Pro upfront. Validate market with Starter plan first. Upgrade only when revenue justifies.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Cleanup
- Moved core OS files from `core/` directory to workspace root for accessibility
- Created `.clawhub/` directory for skill management integration
- Updated README.md to reflect current structure
- All systems verified working (Google APIs, Telegram memory, 2Brain capture, N8N video analysis)

## What's Ready for Monday (Feb 17)

✅ **Live Demo Script** — Cora Copilot (real-time voice → transcript → automation ideas)  
✅ **Tutorial Guide** — 14.5 KB, copy-paste ready for attendees  
✅ **GHL Workflows** — 5 fully documented, manual import guide included  
✅ **Lead Capture Form** — Ready to collect workshop attendee emails  
✅ **Email Sequences** — Pre-built nurture flows (Day 1, 3, 6)  

## What's Ready for Feb 24+ (Post-Rome)

✅ **Cora Copilot Chrome Extension** — Design complete, build sprint ready  
✅ **PersonaPlex / RunPod Demo** — Cost calculated ($1.20/hr A100), waiting for kickoff  
✅ **Cora Voice improvements** — Logging all conversations to Supabase for quality iteration  
✅ **FastTrack Hub research** — Ready to define year-1 KPI targets  

## Key Metrics (Pre-Rome Baseline)

| Engine | Metric | Current | Target (30 days) | Timeline |
|--------|--------|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Authority** | Workshop attendance | 0 (baseline) | 25+ | Feb 17 onward |
| **Authority** | FastTrack Hub members | 0 | 50+ | Mar 1 onward |
| **Revenue** | Pipeline ($) | $90-165K (GHL Phase 1) | Qualified leads from workshop | Feb 17-18 |
| **Revenue** | Berelvant retainer clients | 0 | 1-2 | Mar 15 onward |
| **Product** | Cora Voice daily users | 2 (Renzo + testing) | 10+ | Mar 1 onward |
| **Product** | CVRedi signups | 0 | 5-10 | Mar 1 onward |

## Operational Health Check

| System | Status | Last Check | Next Check |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Telegram Memory (30 min) | ✅ LIVE | 12:00 PM Feb 16 | 12:30 PM |
| 2Brain Capture (6h) | ✅ LIVE | 6:00 AM Feb 16 | 12:00 PM |
| Cora Voice (web app) | ✅ LIVE | 02:30 AM Feb 16 | 14:00 PM |
| Google APIs (gog CLI) | ✅ LIVE | 09:15 AM Feb 16 | 16:00 PM |
| N8N Video Analysis | ✅ LIVE | 08:45 AM Feb 16 | 18:00 PM |
| OpenClaw Gateway | ✅ LIVE | Auto-start verified | Continuous |

**Overall health:** ✅ EXCELLENT. No interventions needed during Rome trip.

## Decisions Made Today

**Decision 1: Focus on workshop materials over premium features**  
- Rationale: Quality delivery > polish. Tutorial guide is higher ROI than fancy UI.
- Confidence: High (attendees care about immediate usability, not aesthetics)

**Decision 2: Defer Agency Pro upgrade until market validates**  
- Rationale: Starter plan ($0) proves concept; upgrade only when revenue exists.
- Confidence: High (proven marketing principle: validate before spending)

**Decision 3: Keep GHL workflows simple for workshop demo**  
- Rationale: "Show, don't tell." Live 2-workflow demo beats theory.
- Confidence: High (simpler wins faster buy-in)

## What's Next (Prioritized)

**This week (Feb 17-23):**
1. Monday: SCORE workshop — deliver live demo, collect 20+ emails
2. Capture attendee feedback on Cora Copilot + Claude capabilities
3. Nurture leads with email sequence (GHL automation)
4. Monitor Telegram memory for workshop mentions

**Next week (Feb 24-Mar 1):**
1. Return from Rome (Feb 23 3:55 PM EST)
2. Review captured feedback + adjust strategy
3. Launch FastTrack Hub (or research → define KPIs first)
4. Begin Cora Copilot build sprint
5. Set up PersonaPlex demo (RunPod A100)

**March (ongoing):**
1. Convert workshop attendees → FastTrack Hub members
2. Market validate GHL workflows (Phase 2)
3. Close 1-2 Berelvant retainer clients
4. Launch Cora Copilot beta
5. Hit Authority, Revenue, Product milestones from table above

## Confidence Assessment

**System reliability:** ✅ VERY HIGH  
**Workshop readiness:** ✅ VERY HIGH  
**Post-Rome strategy:** ✅ HIGH (clear, prioritized, measurable)  
**Rome trip risk:** ✅ LOW (all systems autonomous, no manual intervention needed)
