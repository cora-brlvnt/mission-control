# FastTrack Hub — Research Questions & Open Decisions

## Project Definition
**Type:** Circle platform community  
**Pricing:** $39/mo base, dynamic ($5/50 members)  
**Members:** Target 200-500 in year 1  
**Content:** Weekly Q&As, marketing/tech support, co-built sessions, peer network  
**Status:** Research phase (pending post-Rome decision)

## Open Research Questions

### Business Model (Critical)
**Q1:** What does success look like in year 1?
- Target member count? (200? 500? 1000?)
- Target revenue? ($X/mo recurring)
- Acceptable churn rate? (% per month)
- Retention target? (% retained at 6/12 months)

**Q2:** What drives member acquisition?
- Organic (from workshops, referrals)?
- SCORE-sponsored free tier (paid separately)?
- Upsell from Berelvant clients?
- Influencer/partner channels?

**Q3:** What's the pricing ladder?
- Base tier ($39/mo) — what's included?
- Premium tier? (if yes, what's the upgrade trigger?)
- Annual discount? (standard 10-15%?)
- Founding member incentive? (grandfather old price?)

### Content & Engagement (Strategic)
**Q4:** What are the "stickiness drivers"?
- Weekly Renzo Q&A? (how long, what format?)
- Peer network value? (introductions, collaboration)
- Exclusive resources? (templates, scripts, playbooks)
- Co-built projects? (members build alongside Renzo)

**Q5:** How does FastTrack Hub connect to Authority/Revenue/Product engines?
- Authority: Does membership amplify Renzo's visibility? (testimonials, social proof)
- Revenue: Does membership generate Berelvant leads? (how many qualified?)
- Product: Is FastTrack Hub itself the product, or a funnel to bigger deals?

### Go-to-Market (Tactical)
**Q6:** When do we launch?
- Post-Rome (Feb 24+)?
- After spring workshop season (late March)?
- After Cora Copilot launch (March)?

**Q7:** What's the launch sequence?
- Soft launch (founding members, 50 people)?
- Public launch (all workshop attendees invited)?
- Gradual rollout (weekly cohorts)?

**Q8:** How do we measure success early?
- Week 1: Target signup rate (from workshop audience)
- Month 1: Target retention rate
- Month 3: Target engagement score (attended Q&A %, participated in sessions %)
- Month 6: Target NPS, churn rate, revenue

## Decision Gate
**Owner:** Renzo  
**Timeline:** Feb 24+ (after Rome return + workshop analysis)  
**Input:** Workshop data (conversion rate, attendee feedback, positioning resonance)  
**Output:** Go/No-Go decision + timeline + success metrics

## Default Assumptions (If Renzo doesn't specify)
- **Year 1 target:** 300 members @ $39/mo = $140K ARR
- **Launch:** Early March (post-Rome + Copilot alpha)
- **Stickiness:** Weekly Renzo Q&A + peer network (biggest drivers)
- **Churn:** <5% monthly (standard SaaS target)
- **Acquisition:** 60% organic (workshop attendees), 40% referral

## Remaining Unknowns
- [ ] Exact content format (live Q&A? recorded? async cohorts?)
- [ ] Community tools (Discord? Circle native? Slack?)
- [ ] Moderator model (Renzo only? team members?)
- [ ] Graduation path (does success in FastTrack lead to Berelvant sales?)
- [ ] International scope (English-only or Spanish-language cohort?)

## Next Actions
1. (Feb 24+) Review workshop data with Renzo
2. Ask Q1-Q8 if Renzo hasn't specified defaults
3. Finalize platform + content roadmap
4. Set launch date + success metrics
5. Create 30-day content plan (launch Q&As, onboarding, first projects)
