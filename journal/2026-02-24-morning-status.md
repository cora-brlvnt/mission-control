## Key Data Points (From Feb 23 Session)

**Berelvant SEO Reality Check:**

- GA4: 67 active users, 89 pageviews/month (tiny)
- Target opportunity: "ai automation agency" (1900 search volume)

---

## Next Actions

1. **Wait for Renzo's feedback** on Vision agent outputs
2. **Prepare Wave 2 agents** (Echo, Pixel, Reel, Social) — architecture ready, code pending
3. **Schedule orchestrator cron** once approved (currently manual only)
4. **Iterate docs** based on feedback (formatting, structure, content)

All systems operational. Ready to proceed.
