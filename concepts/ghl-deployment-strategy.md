# GHL Deployment Strategy

## Overview
How to strategically deploy GoHighLevel automation workflows: validate market signal → demonstrate ROI → upgrade to Agency Pro when revenue justifies.

## Three-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Market Validation (Feb 16-17)
**Goal:** Collect leads, test market demand, prove workflow capability

**Activities:**
- Present GHL workflows at SCORE workshop (Feb 17)
- Collect attendee emails (pre-built lead capture form)
- Deploy 2-3 key workflows (Lead Capture SMS, Email Sequence)
- Document results (open rates, reply rates, conversions)

**Success metrics:**
- 20+ qualified leads from workshop
- 5+ active conversations via SMS/email
- 2+ requests for full implementation

**Cost:** $0 (Starter plan)

### Phase 2: Demonstration (Feb 24-Mar 15)
**Goal:** Show ROI, build case for upgrade

**Activities:**
- Run nurture sequences on captured leads
- Measure engagement (open rates, click rates, replies)
- Offer implementation trial (3-month, one workflow per client)
- Document case studies (before/after metrics)

**Success metrics:**
- 10+ trial implementations
- 3+ clients ready to upgrade
- 2+ case studies with >50% improvement in their KPI

**Cost:** $0 (still Starter plan)

### Phase 3: Agency Pro Upgrade (Mar 15+)
**Goal:** Monetize via full workflow capabilities

**Activities:**
- Offer "GHL Automation Services" retainer ($2K-5K/mo per client)
- Deploy full workflow suite (5 workflows listed below)
- Manage campaigns on behalf of clients
- Upgrade Berelvant account to Agency Pro ($497/mo)

**Revenue impact:**
- 3 clients × $3K/mo = $9K/mo (revenue) - $497 (cost) = $8.5K/mo net new

**Cost:** $497/mo (Agency Pro subscription) + potential contractor labor for management

**Confidence:** High (workflow architecture proven, market signal from Phase 1-2)

## Five Core Workflows (Ready to Deploy)

### 1. Lead Capture + SMS Notification
- **Trigger:** Form submission (any source)
- **Action:** Create contact in GHL CRM + send SMS notification to sales team
- **Use case:** Inbound leads, workshop signups, demo requests
- **ROI:** Instant notification = faster response time = higher conversion

### 2. Email Nurture Sequence
- **Trigger:** New lead added to specific tag
- **Sequence:** Day 1 (intro) → Day 3 (value prop) → Day 6 (case study) → Day 9 (call-to-action)
- **Personalization:** First name, company, estimated deal size
- **Use case:** Warm outreach, demo follow-up, nurture stalled deals
- **ROI:** Automated touchpoints = consistent follow-up = higher close rate

### 3. Appointment Reminders
- **Trigger:** Appointment scheduled in GHL calendar
- **Action:** SMS confirmation (24h before) + email reminder (2h before)
- **Personalization:** Calendar link, meeting topic, facilitator name
- **Use case:** Reduce no-shows, improve meeting attendance
- **ROI:** 10-15% reduction in no-shows per industry data

### 4. Pipeline Router
- **Trigger:** Deal stage change (Lead → Prospect → Opportunity → Proposal → Won/Lost)
- **Action:** Send email/SMS to sales rep + log activity + update timeline
- **Personalization:** Deal amount, stage, days in current stage
- **Use case:** Sales team alignment, bottleneck detection
- **ROI:** Visibility into pipeline; faster deal progression

### 5. Two-Way SMS
- **Trigger:** Inbound SMS from prospect
- **Action:** Parse message → classify intent → route to sales rep → respond automatically or manually
- **Personalization:** Prospect name, history, context
- **Use case:** Lead qualification, quick questions, appointment booking
- **ROI:** Faster response time = higher engagement

## Deployment Playbook

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] GHL account created (Starter plan)
- [ ] Workflows documented + tested
- [ ] Import guide created (step-by-step UI instructions)
- [ ] Lead capture form built (workshop, email list, web form)
- [ ] SMS template approved (brand voice, compliance)
- [ ] Email templates designed (responsive, branded)
- [ ] Sales team trained on workflow management
- [ ] Success metrics defined (what are we measuring?)

### Deployment Day
1. Import first 2 workflows (Lead Capture + Email Sequence)
2. Test with internal team (send test lead, verify SMS + email delivery)
3. Go live (toggle automation on)
4. Monitor for 24h (check for any errors, slow response, missing data)
5. Document results (screenshots, metrics, feedback)

### Post-Deployment (Weekly)
- Review new leads captured
- Check engagement metrics (SMS open rate, email open rate, click rate)
- Respond to support issues (if any)
- Optimize email subject lines / SMS text (A/B test)
- Document wins (testimonials, case studies)

### Upgrade Trigger (When to go Agency Pro)
- If 3+ clients ask for full implementation: upgrade immediately
- If 5+ active campaigns running: upgrade to avoid hitting Starter limits
- If projected revenue > $5K/mo: upgrade (ROI positive)

## Key Assumptions

1. **Market demand exists** — SCORE workshop attendees have lead gen / follow-up pain
2. **Workflows save time** — Automation > manual email/SMS (quantifiable savings)
3. **ROI is measurable** — Track lead quality, conversion rate, cost per acquisition
4. **Upgrade justified at scale** — 3 clients × $3K/mo = $9K/mo (covers $497 cost + margin)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Workflows fail after deployment | Loss of credibility, wasted client time | Test thoroughly in staging; have rollback plan |
| No leads from Phase 1 | No proof of market demand | Adjust messaging, try different audience, revisit positioning |
| Clients don't want to upgrade | Revenue doesn't materialize | Offer trial period at reduced cost; collect feedback on missing features |
| SMS compliance issues | Legal risk, account suspension | Use approved SMS text; include opt-out; document consent |
| GHL platform changes API | Workflows break | Monitor GHL changelog; have backup workflow definitions |

## Success Looks Like (30 Days)

- ✅ 20+ qualified leads from workshop
- ✅ 5+ active SMS/email conversations
- ✅ 2+ case studies showing >30% improvement in their metrics
- ✅ 1-2 clients ready to sign retainer agreement
- ✅ Team trained and confident in workflow management
- ✅ GHL Automation Services offering documented (pricing, scope, SLA)
