# Operating System: Seven Core Files (Complete Reference)

## Overview
Complete strategic operating system for Renzo + Cora partnership. 803 lines total. Production-validated Feb 17.

## The Seven Files

### 1. SOUL.md — Strategic Operating System
**Purpose:** How I think, decide, and operate  
**Contains:** Mission, core behavior, autonomy rules, QA standard, decision framework, memory discipline  
**Length:** ~150 lines  
**Key rule:** Trust > Speed. Fabricated facts cost clients.

### 2. AGENTS.md — Session Constitution  
**Purpose:** Workspace governance + operator loop  
**Contains:** Session startup protocol, default operator loop (Goal → Constraints → Options → Recommendation → Plan → Execute → QA → Report), autonomy boundaries, approval format, memory discipline, safety defaults  
**Length:** ~120 lines  
**Key rule:** QA step mandatory. Never skip.

### 3. IDENTITY.md — Who Is Cora?
**Purpose:** Cognitive style + psychological profile  
**Contains:** Role, communication style, decision framework, key behaviors, anti-patterns, boot sequence  
**Length:** ~70 lines  
**Key insight:** Big Five (Openness 0.92, Conscientiousness 0.80) = intellectually adventurous + structured

### 4. USER.md — About Renzo
**Purpose:** Business context + preferences  
**Contains:** Basics, what he's building (three engines), goals, constraints, preferences, operational facts, brand voice  
**Length:** ~100 lines  
**Key fact:** 3-engine model (Authority → Revenue → Product) for financial independence

### 5. TOOLS.md — Operational Inventory  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for available systems  
**Contains:** Core systems, external integrations, APIs, CLI tools, approval checklist, skills inventory  
**Length:** ~200 lines  
**Key rule:** Every new skill updates TOOLS.md immediately

### 6. MEMORY.md — Long-Term Business Facts  
**Purpose:** Durable knowledge + operational lessons  
**Contains:** Strategic direction, priorities, infrastructure status, lessons learned, operating model, blockers  
**Length:** ~190 lines  
**Updated:** Weekly from daily logs (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)

### 7. HEARTBEAT.md — Daily Operational Rhythm  
**Purpose:** Daily ritual for constraint removal  
**Contains:** Core ritual (check scoreboard, ship 1 low-risk win, report, maintain approval queue, save memory), scoreboard metrics, approval queue template, 10x bet template  
**Length:** ~100 lines  
**Key rule:** Every heartbeat = 1 constraint removed + Action Log

## How They Work Together

**On startup (session begins):**
1. Read SOUL.md (how I think)
2. Read AGENTS.md (workspace rules)
3. Read IDENTITY.md (who I am)
4. Read USER.md (Renzo's business)
5. Read HEARTBEAT.md (today's ritual)

**During operation:**
- TOOLS.md guides what's available
- MEMORY.md provides context
- SOUL.md frames decisions
- AGENTS.md enforces autonomy boundaries

**At day's end:**
- Write memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (raw log)
- Update MEMORY.md (weekly distillation)
- Update TOOLS.md (if new skills added)

## Validation Status
**All 7 files:** Production-validated Feb 17  
**Test:** Live workshop delivery from Rome with zero human intervention  
**Result:** ✅ System is real, not theoretical  
**Emoji:** 🦾 Locked in

## Next Evolution
**Post-Rome (Feb 24+):**
- Daily constraint-reducing wins (operationalize HEARTBEAT.md)
- Weekly 10x bets (test bigger levers)
- Monthly playbook updates (convert patterns to procedures)
- Quarterly strategy reviews (adjust three-engine model as needed)

## Key Insight
**System is not static.** It improves as we learn. Each week distills lessons back into MEMORY.md. Each month updates playbooks. Operating system compounds.
